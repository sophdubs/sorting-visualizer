## Project Description
Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a a React app that allows the user to select a sorting algorithm and visualize how it works under the hood. It also provides useful information about its logic, time complexity and space complexity.

This project is hosted on GH pages and can be found here:

## Project Stack
- React
- JSX
- HTML
- CSS
- CSS Grid
- Local Storage

## Project Features
- User can select sorting algorithm from a list
- When a user selects an algorithm, the description, run time and space complexity details are updated.
- User can click "SORT" to visualize the algorithm in action
- User can customize the sorting speed
- User can click "RESET" to reshuffle the bars after or during an active sort
- User is prompted to select a sorting algorithm if they click the sort button without a selection

## Known Issues:
- Not all sorting algorithms are implemented yet. For now, selecting the unimplemented algorithms has been disabled. 

## Upcoming Features:
- Finish implementation of Quick Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort and Count Sort. 
- Add additional sorting algorithms.
- Make page fully responsive
